# server{} - the server context is nested inside the http context and used for configuring specific virtual servers
# within a single host. A server is considered a virtual host.
server {
	#<listen> is one of the ways to identify the correct server context within a configuration
	#certbot is instructing NGINX to listen for any HTTPS request on port 443
	listen 443 ssl;
	listen [::]:443 ssl;

	#<server_name> defines name of server and server block, that are used for the requests to my server
	server_name rkultaev.42.fr;

	#<ssl_certificate> directive is used for indication location of certificate and 
	#private key file on the server

	ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;

	#<index>
	#NGINX by default looks for an index.html to serve. But in the project, index.php.
	#So by writing [index index.php] I instruct NGINX to use [index.php] as root instead
	#In case [index index.php index.html] NGINX will first look for index.php.
	#If it doesn't find that file, it will look for [index.html] file
	index index.php index.html;

	#<root> directive is used for declaring the root directory for a site.
	#By writing /var/www/html/wordpress Im telling NGINX to look for files to serve inside 
	#that directory if any request comes to server.
	#Its the mountpoint while building with instructions to dockerfile wp
	root /var/www/html/wordpress;

	#By writing <location> defines how NGINX should handle requests for different resources
	#and URIS for parent server
	#Instance where processing location may be reevaluated is with <try_files> directive.
	#This directive tells NGINX to check for existence of a named set of files or dirs.
	#Last parameter can be URI that NGINX will make an internal redirect to.

	#To create NGINX server block that will make use of FPM pool , we edit config file and pass the path 
	#of pool's socket file using option [fastcgi_pass] inside location block for php

	#PHP-FPM service by default runs on port 9000 of the host.
